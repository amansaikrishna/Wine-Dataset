# Wine Dataset Analysis and Classification

The wine dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.This dataset contains 13 different parameters for wine with 178 samples. The purpose of this wine dataset in scikit-learn is to predict the best wine class among 3 classes.

I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and provided various visualisations.Then I scaled and splited the data into training and testing sets.

I have used Five Supervised Learning Algorithms : 1.Logistic Regression 2.K Nearest Neighbour 3.Gaussian Naive Bayes 4.Decision Tree 5.Support Vector Machines.

Most of the Algorithms performed very well.
